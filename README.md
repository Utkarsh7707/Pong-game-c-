step 1 : you have to install raylib library first in you pc
        procedurer to install in linux and windows is different so please check out some youtube vids to do so 

step 2 : download the c++ file and build.sh file 

step 3 : run the file 

use this command to run this in linux :
g++ main.cpp -o my_program -lraylib -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11


or you could simply run build.sh to run the file but you have to make build.sh executable first
